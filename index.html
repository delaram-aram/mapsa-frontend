                    I’ve been thinking a lot about failure lately. Failure comes in many forms, but

                    I’m especially interested in situations in which people *perceive* something
                    
                    as failing (or about to fail) and the contestations over failure that often arise
                    
                    in such situations. Given this, it’s hard not to be fascinated by all that’s
                    
                    unfolding around Twitter. At this point in the story of Musk’s takeover, there’s
                    
                    a spectrum of perspectives about Twitter’s pending doom (or lack thereof).
                    
                    But there’s more to failure than the binary question of “will Twitter fail or
                    
                    won’t it?” Here’s some thoughts on how I’m thinking about the failure 
                    
                    question...

                    1.Failure of social media sites tends to be slow then fast.
                    </b>
                    I spent a ridiculous amount of time in the aughts trying to understand the

                    rise and fall of social network sites like Friendster and MySpace. I noticed
                    
                    something fascinating. If a central node in a network disappeared and went
                    
                    somewhere else (like from MySpace to Facebook), that person could pull
                    
                    some portion of their connections with them to a new site. However, if the
                    
                    accounts on the site that drew emotional intensity stopped doing so, people
                    
                    stopped engaging as much. Watching Friendster come undone, I started to
                    
                    think that the fading of emotionally sticky nodes was even more problematic
                    
                    than the disappearance of segments of the graph.


                    With MySpace, I was trying to identify the point where I thought the site was
                    
                    going to unravel. When I started seeing the disappearance of emotionally
                    
                    sticky nodes, I reached out to members of the MySpace team to share my
                    
                    concerns and they told me that their numbers looked fine. Active uniques
                    
                    were high, the amount of time people spent on the site was continuing to
                    
                    grow, and new accounts were being created at a rate faster than accounts
                    
                    were being closed. I shook my head; I didn’t think that was enough. A few
                    
                    months later, the site started to unravel.

                    <font face="Helvetica" size="15">                                                      
                                                                                               
                    On a different project, I was talking with a cis/hetero dating site that was struggling
                        
                    with fraud. Many of its “fake” accounts were purportedly “women” 
                        
                    but they were really a scam to entice people into paying for a porn 
                        
                    site. But when the site started removing these profiles, they found that the 
                    
                    site as a whole was unraveling. Men didn’t like these fake women, but their 
                    
                    profiles enticed them to return. Moreover, attractive women saw these 
                    
                    profiles and felt like it was a site full of people more attractive than them so 
                    
                    they came. When the fake women disappeared, the real women disappeared. 
                    
                    And so did the men.



                    Network effects intersect with perception to drive a sense of a site’s social
                    
                    relevance and interpersonal significance.



                    I don’t have access to the Twitter social graph these days, but I’d bet my 
                    
                    bottom dollar that it would indicate whether or not the site was on a 
                    
                    trajectory towards collapse. We are certainly seeing entire sub-networks 
                    
                    flock to Mastodon, but that’s not as meaningful as people might think 
                    
                    because of the scale and complexity of the network graph. You can lose 
                    
                    whole segments and not lose a site. However, if those departing are creating 
                    
                    Swiss cheese into the network graph, then I would worry.



                    The bigger question concerns those emotionally sticky nodes. What 
                    
                    constitutes a “can’t be missed” account or post varies. What draws someone 
                    
                    to a service like Twitter varies. For some, it is the libidinal joy of seeing 
                    
                    friends and community, the posts that provide light touch pleasure and joy. 
                    
                    For others, it’s a masochistic desire for seeing content that raises one’s blood 
                    
                    pressure. Still others can’t resist the drama of a train wreck.



                    The funny thing about Twitter’s feed algorithms is that they were designed to
                    
                    amplify the content that triggered the most reaction, those emotionally 
                    
                    sticky posts. This is why boring but informative content never has a chance 
                    
                    against that which prompts fury. But it also means that we’re all watching 
                    
                    how our little universe of content is changing (or not). Are you still seeing 
                    
                    the things that give you pleasure? Or just the stuff that makes you angry? 
                    
                    Why can’t you resist looking away from the things that give you pain? (That 
                    
                    question isn’t a new one… it’s the question that underlies our toxic social 
                    
                    media ecology more generally.)




                    I have to give Musk and gang some credit for knowing that drama brings
                    
                    traffic. The drama that unfolds in the World Cup is wholesome compared to
                    
                    the drama of watching public acts of humiliation, cruelty, and hate. We’re in 
                    
                    a modern day Coliseum watching a theater of suffering performed for the 
                    
                    king under the rubric of “justice.” And just like the ancient Romans, we can’t 
                    
                    look away.




                    But how long can the spectacle last? Even the Roman Empire eventually
                    
                    collapsed, but perhaps the theater of the absurd can persist for a while. Still, 
                    
                    there are other factors to consider.

                    2. Failure can be nothing more than a normal accident that tears down the 
                    infrastructure.
                    </b>
                    Nearly everyone I talk with is surprised that the actual service of Twitter is 
                    
                    mostly still working. What that says to me is that the engineering team was 
                    
                    far more solid than I appreciated. Any engineering team worth its salt is 
                    
                    going to build redundancy and resilience into the system. Exceptions that 
                    
                    are thrown should be caught and managed. But that doesn’t mean that a 
                    
                    system can persist indefinitely without <ins>maintenance and repair</ins>.


                    Think of it in terms of a house. If you walk away from your home for a while, 
                    
                    the pipes will probably keep working fine on their own. Until a big freeze 
                    
                    comes. And then, if no one is looking, they’ll burst, flood the house, and 
                    
                    trigger failure after failure. The reason for doing maintenance is to minimize 
                    
                    the likelihood of this event. And the reason to have contingencies built in is 
                    
                    to prevent a problem from rippling across the system.


                    What happens when Twitter’s code needs to be tweaked to manage an iOS 
                    
                    upgrade? Or if a library dependency goes poof? What happens when a 
                    
                    security vulnerability isn’t patched?


                    One interesting concept in organizational sociology is “normal accidents 
                    
                    theory.” <ins>Studying Three Mile Island</ins>, Charles Perrow created a 2x2 grid 
                    
                    before b-schools everywhere made this passé.

                            One axis represented the complexity of interactions in a system; the other 
                            
                            axis reflected the “coupling” of a system. A loosely coupled system has little 
                            
                            dependencies, but a tightly coupled system has components that are highly 
                            
                            dependent on others. Perrow argued that “normal accidents” were nearly 
                            
                            inevitable in a complex, tightly coupled system. To resist such an outcome, 
                            
                            systems designers needed to have backups and redundancy, safety checks 
                            
                            and maintenance. In the language of computers, resilience requires having 
                            
                            available “buffer” to manage any overflow.


                            Having dozens of engineers working around the clock to respond to crises 
                            
                            can temporarily prevent failure. But those engineers will get tired, mistakes 
                            
                            will happen, and maintenance will get kicked down the road. Teams need 
                            
                            buffer as much as systems do.


                            I’m concerned about the state of the team at Twitter, not just because so 
                            
                            many people were laid off. If my hunch is right, many of the engineers who 
                            
                            are keeping Twitter going fall into four groups. There are immigrants on 
                            
                            H1Bs who are effectively indentured servants, many of whom would leave if 
                            
                            they could, but the industry is falling apart which makes departures unlikely. 
                            
                            There are also apolitical engineers who need a job and there are few jobs to 
                            
                            be found in the industry right now. Neither of these groups will want to drive 
                            
                            themselves to the bone in the long term. Then there are Musk fanboys who 
                            
                            want to ride this rollercoaster for whatever personal motivation. And there 
                            
                            are goons on loan from other public companies that Musk owns. (Side note: 
                            
                            how how how is it legal for Musk to use employees from public companies 
                            
                            for his private project!?!? Is this something that the Delaware courts are 
                            
                            going to influence?)

                            Whale, the iconic image that Twitter posted when something went terribly 
                            
                            awry in the system, requiring it to be shut down and, effectively, rebooted. 
                            
                            It’s been a long time since we saw the Fail Whale because there was a strong 
                            
                            infrastructure team who worked to bake resilience into the system. In other 
                            
                            words, Twitter grew up.


                            How long can the resilience of the system allow it to keep functioning? It 
                            
                            could be quite a while. But I also can’t help but think of a video I saw years 
                            
                            ago about what would happen to New York City if the humans suddenly 
                            
                            disappeared overnight. First the pipes burst and the rats invaded. But 
                            
                            without humans leaving behind trash, the rats eventually died. The critters 
                            
                            that remained? The cockroaches of course.

                            </b>
                            If you searched for “miserable failure” (or even just “failure”) on September 
                            
                            29, 2006, the first result was the official George W. Bush biography. This act 
                            
                            of <ins>“Google bombing”</ins> made the internet lol. But it also hinted at a broader 
                            
                            dynamic related to failure. There are failures that everyone can agree are 
                            
                            failures (e.g. the explosion of the Challenger), but most failures are a matter 
                            
                            of perception.


                            Politicians, policies, companies, and products are often deemed a “failure” 
                            
                            rhetorically by those who oppose them, regardless of any empirical measure 
                            
                            one might use. George W. Bush was deemed a failure by those who were 
                            
                            opposed to his “War on Terrorism.” Declaring something a failure is a way to 
                            
                            delegitimize it. And when something is delegitimized, it can become a 
                            
                            failure.

                            I often think back to MySpace’s downfall. In 2007, I <ins>penned a controversial</ins>

                            and MySpace. A few years later, <ins>I noted the role of the news media in this</ins> 
                                        
                            <ins>division</ins>, highlighting how media coverage about MySpace as scary, 
                                        
                            dangerous, and full of pedophiles (regardless of empirical evidence) helped 
                                        
                            make this division possible. The news media played a role in delegitimizing 
                                        
                            MySpace (aided and abetted by a team at Facebook, which was directly 
                                        
                            benefiting from this delegitimization work).


                            Perception (including racism and classism) have shaped the social media 

                            landscape since the beginning.


                            A lot has changed about our news media ecosystem since 2007. In the United 
                            
                            States, it’s hard to overstate how the media is entangled with contemporary 
                            
                            partisan politics and ideology. This means that information tends not to flow 
                            
                            across partisan divides in coherent ways that enable debate. In general, 
                            
                            when journalists/advocates/regular people on the left declare conservative 
                            
                            politicians/policies to be failures, this has little impact on the right because it 
                            
                            is actively ignored by the media outlets consumed by those on the right. But 
                            
                            interestingly, when journalists/advocates/regular people on the right declare 
                            
                            progressive politicians/policies to be failures, both mainstream media and 
                            
                            the left obsessively amplify falsehoods and offensive content in an attempt to 
                            
                            critique and counteract them. (Has anyone on the left managed to avoid 
                            
                            hearing about the latest round of celebrity anti-Semitism?)


                            I’m especially fascinated by how the things that are widely deemed failures 
                            
                            are deemed failures for different reasons across the political spectrum. 
                            
                            Consider the withdrawal in Afghanistan. The right did a fantastic job of 
                            
                            rhetorically spinning this as a Biden failure, while the left criticized aspects 
                            
                            of the mission. This shared perception of failure landed in the collective 
                            
                            public consciousness; there was no need to debate why individual groups 
                            
                            saw it as failure. Of course, this also meant that there was no shared 
                            
                            understanding of what led to that point, no discussion of what should’ve 
                            
                            been done other than it should’ve been done better. Perceptions of failure 
                            
                            don’t always lead to shared ideas of how to learn from these lessons.


                            The partisan and geopolitical dimensions of perception related to Twitter are 
                            
                            gobsmacking. Twitter has long struggled to curb hate, racism, anti-Semitism, 
                            
                            transphobia, and harassment. For a long time, those on the right have 
                            
                            labeled these efforts censorship. Under the false flag of freedom of speech, 
                            
                            the new Twitter has eradicated most safeguards, welcoming in a new era of 
                            
                            amplified horrors, with the news media happily covering this spectacle. 
                            
                            (This is what led Joan Donovan and I to talk about the importance of <ins>strategic</ins>
                            
                            <ins>silence</ins>.)


                            Musk appears to be betting that the spectacle is worth it. He’s probably 
                            
                            correct in thinking that large swaths of the world will not deem his 
                            
                            leadership a failure either because they are ideologically aligned with him or 
                            
                            they simply don’t care and aren’t seeing any changes to their corner of the 
                            
                            Twitterverse.


                            He also appears to believe that the advertising community will eventually 
                            
                            relent because they always seem to do so when an audience is lingering 
                            
                            around. And with a self-fashioned Gladiator torturing his enemies for sport 
                            
                            in front of a live audience, there are lots of dollars on the table. Musk 
                            
                            appears convinced that capitalistic interests will win out.


                            So the big question in my mind is: how effective will the perception that 
                            
                            Twitter is failing be in the long run, given how it is not jumping across 
                            
                            existing ideological divisions? Perception of failure can bring about failure, 
                            
                            but it doesn’t always. That’s the story of many brands who resist public 
                            
                            attacks. Perception of failure can also just fade into the background, reifying 
                            
                            existing divisions.


                            Of course, a company needs money and the only revenue stream Twitter has 
                            
                            stems from advertising. This is one of the reasons that activism around the 
                            
                            advertisers matters. If advocates can convince advertisers to hold out, that 
                            
                            will starve a precarious system. That is a tangible way to leverage perception 
                            
                            of failure. Same can be said if advocates manage to convince Apple or Google 
                            
                            to de-list. Or if perception can be leveraged into court fights, Congressional 
                            
                            battles, or broader policy sanctions. But right now, it seems as though 
                            
                            perception has gotten caught in the left/right cultural war that is unfolding in 
                            
                            the United States.

                            </b>
                            There are many ways in which the Twitter story could end, but it’s important 
                            
                            to remember that most companies do eventually end (or become 
                            
                            unrecognizable after 100+ years). The internet is littered with failed 
                            
                            companies. And even though companies like Yahoo! still have a website, they 
                            
                            are in a “permanently failing” status. Most companies fail when they run out 
                            
                            of money. And the financials around Twitter are absurd. As a company, it has 
                            
                            persisted almost entirely on a single profit stream: advertising. That 
                            
                            business strategy requires eyeballs. As we’ve already witnessed, a 
                            
                            subscription plan for salvation is a joke.


                            The debt financing around Twitter is gob-smacking. I cannot for the life of 
                            
                            me understand what the creditors were thinking, but the game of finance is 
                            
                            a next level sport where destroying people, companies, and products to 
                            
                            achieve victory is widely tolerated. Historical trends suggest that the losers 
                            
                            in this chaos will not be Musk or the banks, but the public.


                            For an anchor point, consider the collapse of local news journalism. The 
                            
                            myth that this was caused by craigslist or Google drives me bonkers. 
                            
                            Throughout the 80s and 90s, private equity firms and hedge funds gobbled 
                            
                            up local news enterprises to extract their real estate. They didn’t give a shit 
                            
                            about journalism; they just wanted prime real estate that they could develop. 
                            
                            And news organizations had it in the form of buildings in the middle of 
                            
                            town. So financiers squeezed the news orgs until there was no money to be 
                            
                            squeezed and then they hung them out to dry. There was no configuration in 
                            
                            which local news was going to survive, no magical upwards trajectory of 
                            
                            revenue based on advertising alone. If it weren’t for craigslist and Google, the 
                            
                            financiers would’ve squeezed these enterprises for a few more years, but the 
                            
                            end state was always failure. Failure was the profit strategy for the 
                            
                            financiers. (It still boggles my mind how many people believe that the loss of 
                            
                            news journalism is because of internet advertising. I have to give financiers 
                            
                            credit for their tremendous skill at shifting the blame.)

                                I highly doubt that Twitter is going to be a 100-year company. For better or 
                                
                                worse, I think failure is the end state for Twitter. The question is not if but 
                                
                                when, how, and who will be hurt in the process?


                                Right now, what worries me are the people getting hurt. I’m sickened to 
                                
                                watch “journalists” aid and abet efforts to publicly shame former workers 
                                
                                (especially junior employees) in a sadistic game of “accountability” that truly 
                                
                                perverts the concept. I’m terrified for the activists and vulnerable people 
                                
                                around the world whose content exists in Twitter’s databases, whose private 
                                
                                tweets and DMs can be used against them if they land in the wrong hands 
                                
                                (either by direct action or hacked activity). I’m disgusted to think that this 
                                
                                data will almost certainly be auctioned off.


                                Frankly, there’s a part of me that keeps wondering if there’s a way to end this 
                                
                                circus faster to prevent even greater harms. (Dear Delaware courts, any 
                                
                                advice?)


                                No one who creates a product wants to envision failure as an inevitable end 
                                
                                state. Then again, humans aren’t so good at remembering that death is an 
                                
                                inevitable end state either. But when someone doesn’t estate plan, their 
                                
                                dependents are left with a mess. Too many of us have watched the 
                                
                                devastating effects of dementia and, still, few of us plan for all that can go 
                                
                                wrong when our minds fall apart and we lash out at the ones we love. Few 
                                
                                companies die a graceful death either. And sadly, that’s what I expect we’re 
                                
                                about to see. A manic, demented creature hurting everyone who loved it on

                                <b>Closing Thoughts</b>

                                I’m not omniscient. I don’t know where this story ends. But after spending 
                                
                                the last few years obsessing over what constitutes failure, I can’t help but 
                                
                                watch this situation with a rock in my stomach.


                                Failure isn’t a state, but a process. It can be a generative process. After all, 
                                
                                some plants only grow after a forest fire. (And yes, yes, tech is currently 
                                
                                obsessed with “fail fast.” But frankly, that’s more about a status game than 
                                
                                actually learning.)


                                Failure should not always be the end goal. There’s much to be said about the 
                                
                                journey, about living a worthy life, about growing and learning and being 
                                
                                whole. Yet, what keeps institutions, systems, companies, and products whole 
                                
                                stems from how they are configured within a network of people, practices, 
                                
                                and perception. Radical shifts in norms, values, and commitments can 
                                
                                rearrange how these networks are configured. This is why transitions are 
                                
                                hard and require a well-thought through strategy to prevent failure, 
                                
                                especially if the goal is to be whole ethically.


                                Watching this situation unfold, a little voice keeps nagging in my head. How 
                                
                                should our interpretation of this situation shift if we come to believe that 
                                
                                failure is the desired end goal? There’s a big difference between a natural 
                                
                                forest fire and one that stems from the toxic mixture of arson and climate 
                                
                                change.
